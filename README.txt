Recensio buildout
=================

This buildout largely follows the gocept standard.
That means, all important buildout configs are in the profile folder.

But this buildout.cfg_sample contains some more entries too.
It contains all entries for secrets that must not be checked in.

Also, there is a cron.cfg, this is used to manage the user crontab.
It builds the crontab with "secret" information it retrieves from the
buildout.cfg. For that reason, the crontab is not versioned as is.

Lastly, we have to versions files, picked_versions.cfg and versions.cfg
The reason for that is explained in the feature "Update features"

Extras
======

Scripts dir
-----------
Here are some helpers versionized that are useful for this client only.

- vdexconverter.py
  A One off script to convert excels to vdex. Was used more than once.

translation_stats dir
----------------------
Some rudimental helpers for translations. To check completeness and
visualize it.
It is important to know that po files are purely autogenerated, and
one of the helpers checks, that the autogenerated po files are up to date

fabric
------
We have a fabric script!
run fab -l to see the features it offers.

versions
--------
We have picked_versions.cfg and versions.cfg. All versions that have only been
pinned, because we need to pin to something, are pinned in picked_versions.cfg
All other version requirements are either from the Plone KGS or are pinned
because it is known that newer versions are incompatible. If so, the reason is
documented.
The dev buildout provides a script for checking newer versions of eggs:
./bin/checkversions profiles/picked_versions.cfg -v
This returns newer versions if available.
