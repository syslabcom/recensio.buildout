This directory contains a bunch of scripts related to translations

translations_complete.sh
========================
This little tool checks that the translation string list is up to date.
It will not check the completeness of translations.
All translation strings are generated by running a script that checks the
sources for possible translation strings. If something changes here, people
must react in one way or another. Thus it is important to always update the
strings. Since this does not happen automatically, the tool allows to check
this. It exits with an exit status != 0 if something is wrong. This can be
used by test systems to validate the up to date ness.

generate_stats.sh
=================
This searches the complete history of the translations package.
It assumes that the package is checked out, up to date and cloned with git.
It will generate a stats file that does not help you very much.

gnuplot_commands.cmd
====================
This file is a list of commands to generate a graph from the stats generated
by generate_stats.sh.
It generates images, the lang.html references the images. The html file does
not get regenerated automatically.

lang.html
=========
This file uses the images generated by the gnuplot_commands.cmd. This
is just a simple way to visualize the stats.
